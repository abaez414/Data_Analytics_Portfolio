# UFOs

## Overview
For this challenge we used JavaScript to build a dynamic webpage to display data for different UFO sightings. We also used HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS to style the page. The webpage is interactive, allowing the user to search for UFO sightings based on different sets of criteria.

## Results
Here is a picture of what the UFO Finder website should look like when you visit it:

You can see the title of the page with the outter space header, as well as the title and summary of the description of the purpose of the page. Once you read through the summary paragraph, you will see the filters that a user can use to display only specific sightings in the data table. In the next picture, the only criteria that was searched for is sightings on the date 1/12/2010. The other filter options were left blank, however they display the sample text for each box. A user could search using any/all of the listed filters.

## Summary
As you can see, this creates a clean and well laid out website. One drawback to this page is that it can be hard to tell if something has been typed into the search filters based on the sample text that was modeled and written into the code. Two recommendations that I would have to make the website more user friendly would be to leave out the example code (users know what to put in the boxes based on the prompt above each box), and I would suggest putting the button back in that was removed for the challenge. I would also suggest adding a button to clear the search filters to make it faster to look up a new search.
