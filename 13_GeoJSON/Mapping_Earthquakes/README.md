# Mapping Earthquakes

## Project Overview
For this assignment, we used javascript/GeoJSON to create interactive maps from the Mapbox API that help visualize earthquake data. We created visuals to show the difference between the magnitudes of the earthquakes, and included the lines for tectonic plates in order to compare the two sets of data. We used JavaScript and the d3.js library o retrieve coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data, and we used the Leaflet library to plot the data. We created different layers to examine the data in different contrasts.

## Results
###### Earthquakes vs. Tectonic Plates - Streets Layer

###### Earthquakes vs. Tectonic Plates - Satellite Layer

###### Earthquakes vs. Tectonic Plates - Dark Layer
