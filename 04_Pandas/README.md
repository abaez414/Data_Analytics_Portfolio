# School Analysis
## Overview:
In our original analysis, we were looking at the budget and scores of 15 different schools. However, after finding that the 9th graders at one of the schools may have compromised scores, we are now looking at the same data without the compromised scores.

## Results:
* After taking out the scores of the 9th graders at Thomas High School, it is interesting to see that the percent of passing grades is almost perfect. The percent of students passing math, reading, or both are all above 90%. This means that the percent of passing math, reading, and overall scores increased for Thomas High School once the 9th graders' scores were removed from the data.
* By taking out the scores of the 9th graders at Thomas High School, this brought Thomas High School from being in the bottom five performing schools in the district to the second best performing school.
* By replacing the ninth-grade scores from Thomas High School:
  * The district summary did not change.
  * The math and reading scores by grade stayed the same, except for the scores from Thomas High School, which were non-existant.
  * The scores by school spending pretty much stayed the same. Thomas High School effected the $631-$645 spending bin. The new averages were only changed by hundredths of a point.
  * The scores by school size were mildly effected. Since Thomas High School fell into the Medium school size, all of the data in that row was changed by hundredths of a point. When formatted to a whole number, this basically did not change the outcome of the scores.
  * For the scores by school type, the new score changed the Charter row by a few hundreths of a point as well. The average math and passing math score went down by a couple hundreths, and the average reading and passing reading went up by a couple hundredths. However, once formatted to a single or no decimal place, it did not change the scores here either.
 
 ## Sumary
 Once the school district analysis was updated, the biggest changes to the data were:
  1. The percent of students passing math.
  2. The percent of students passing reading.
  3. The percent of overall passing students.
  4. Where Thomas High School scores ranked among the other 14 schools in the district.
