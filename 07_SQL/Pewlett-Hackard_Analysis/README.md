# Pewlett-Hackard Analysis

## Overview
For this analysis, we looked at the employees of Pewlette-Hackard and determined the titles of employees who are going to be ready to retire, as well as identify  employees who would eligibile for a mentorship program to help train and guide newly hired employees. We took this information from the original 6 tables of data and filtered or joined tables to identify the employees that we are interested in.

## Results
1. The two titles at Pewlett-Hackard that have the most employees getting ready to retire is Senior Engineer and Senior Staff. This means that these are the two titles that will need to promote or hire the most employees to make up for the ones that are retiring.

2. Based on the two titles that will have the most employees retiring, it would be best if the mentorship program focuses the most on employees that could fill these positions. As of right now the title Senior Staff has the most employees eligible for the mentorship program, but Senior Engineer has the third most employees eligible, as seen in the table below.

This means that the Senior Engineers will have to work extra hard to make sure that they are training employees that could be promoted into these spots.

3. There are about 3 times as many employees retiring as there are employees eligible for the mentorship program (as evident below by the two counts). This means that having a one-on-one mentorship program may not help enough employees to fill all of the positions that are soon-to-be available. This leads me to believe that the mentorship would work best if mentors had multiple mentees.

4. The table below shows that the two departments with the least amount of employees retiring (by far) are the Managers and the Assistant Engineers. This is probably because most employees in this position would eventually be promoted and moved up to a different position over time. If these employees are retiring from these positions, I would guess that they did not work in these positions for very long. Maybe they started working at Pewlette-Hackard with only a few years before they wanted to retire.

## Summary
As the "silver tsunami" approaches, there will be 41,380 positions opening up that will need to be filled. Being that there are only 1,549 employees eligible for the mentorship program, that means the mentors will have to work with a number of employees each in order to help guide the new employees that could potentially move into these soon-to-be open positions. Either that, or Pewlette-Hackard might consider changing their mentorship criteria to include a larger number of potential mentors.
