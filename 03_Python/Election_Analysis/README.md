### Election_Audit Summary
This script is a great outline for other elections as well. If given a CSV document with the data in the same order, most of this script would run the same. The lists and dictionaries established would work for any document set up with the County in the second column and the Candidate in the third column. Even if the document was set up differently, you would simply have to change the index to account for the new layout. Everything else is set up to accommodate for other counties and/or candidates as well. It would all depend on the setup of the CSV document.
