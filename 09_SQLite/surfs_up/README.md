# surfs_up

## Overview
This is a project on advanced data storage and retrieval using SQLite. For this project, we looked at weather information from Oahu, Hawaii to determine if it would be profitable to build a surf shop and ice cream stand there. 

## Results
1. The temperatures in the months of June and December do not seem to vary that much. 
    - The average temperature in June is just under 75 degrees, and the average temperature in December is 71 degrees, making it only a 4 degree difference.
2. The standard deviation among both months is very close, showing that the variance for both months does not differ that much as well.
    - The standard deviation is slightly more consistent in June. It is higher in December, but the numbers are not far enough apart to make a difference.
    - This shows that the temperature is rather consistent during both halves of the year.
3. The extreme temperatures are rather close as well. The maximum temperatures only differ by 2 degrees. The minimum temperatures have an 8 degree difference, which is more significant, however it does not seem to be enough to reconsider using this location for the surf and ice cream shop.

## Summary
Based on the temperature analysis, it seems that Oahu would be a great location for the surf and ice cream shop. Although, I would recommend looking into a couple more aspects of weather before making the final decision.
1. The first thing that I would look into would be the precipitation in Oahu. The temperature might be right, but if it is raining all the time, that could lead to less surfing, and possibly less ice cream consumption if people are not able to sit outside and consume their icecream.
2. The next thing I would look into would be the summary statistics for each of the recording stations. This would help to narrow down the best location to build the surf and ice cream shop. I would write a query to compare the different stations to see if there is one station that stands out among the others as being the most stable to build the shop.
