# Citibike Analyzation using Tableau

## Overview
The purpose of this module is to create visualizations for the data from NYC Citibike bike-sharing program to see if it would be lucrative to open a bike-share program in Des Moines, Iowa.

## Results
#### The results of the analysis can be viewed in a Tableau story [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/CitibikeAnalysis_16586732600820/CitibikeAnalysis?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
The following are some key results of the analysis for New York City
- When looking at trips shorter than 2 hours, the length of most of the bikes rides are less than an hour. More specifically 20 minutes or less.
- For the month of August, most of the rentals were started at 5:00 or 6:00 PM.
- It is mostly men that rent bikes. It is almost three times as many men than women that rest bikes.
- During the week, the bike rentals are usually in the morning (before a typical work day would begin), or in the evenings (when a typical work day would end). On the weekends the rentals are more consistent throughout the day.
- The majority of customers are subscribers. Looking at the time of day in which they rent the bikes, it seems that it is working males that use the bike-sharing business as transportation to and from work.
- In looking at the heat map for the end times of bike rentals, it is darkest in the morning (between 7:00 and 9:00 AM), then there is a significant color change for 10:00 AM. It then gets drastically darker by 5:00 PM, when a typical work day ends.
- In looking at the map of the top starting locations, the largest number of rentals are in the heart of the city. As you look farther from the city, the circles get smaller. This could be because the people in the city do not have cars and need an alternative fom of transportation, whereas the people in the suburbs probably have a car and less need of a bike rental.

## Summary
In looking at the data, it seems that the bike rentals are the most popular among working men during the week. The most rentals occur in the city, and lessen farther away from the city. If investors are considering starting their own bike-share proram in their location, I would recommend they consider if it is a large business area, or location where people are less likely to have a car and more likely to need alternative transportation. I would recommend a deeper look into why there are so many more men renting bikes than women because that might help investors taylor where or how they start their business.
