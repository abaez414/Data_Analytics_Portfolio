# PyBer Analysis

## Overview:
For this analysis we are looking at the ride and fare information for a number of rides in rural, urban, and suburban cities through the company PyBer. The goal is to look at the rideshare data to improve access and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

## Results
In looking for the underserved cities, it is clear from the following dataframe that the rural cities have the least number of rides, and the highest average fare per ride.

The urban cities have the largest amount of rides, the largest amount of drivers by a lot, and their average fare-per-ride is significantly lower than the rural cities. The suburban cities seem to be inbetween the other two types of cities when looking at the data. But it is clear that the urban cities have the most accessibility for PyBer customers, and at a cheaper cost.

In the graph seen below for Total Fares, it shows that even though the urban average fare per ride is significantly lower than the rural one, there is a higher total of fares for the urban cities. This makes sense as the quantity of rides in the urban cities is so much larger. It seems, from the data, that the more rides there are, the lower the average fare per ride (which appeals to the customer), and the higher number of rides in total (which appeals to the company).

## Summary
Based on these results, I would recommend to the CEO:
 1. Market more to the rural cities. It would be beneficial to increase the number of rides in the rural cities to get them to be closer to the urban cities.
 2. There seems to be a peak in business for all city tpes at the end of February, and then a drop in all city types at the beginning of March. It might be a good idea to offer a promotion or discount during that first week of March to encourage more rides and discounnts during that lower period.
 3. Towards the beginning of April, the suburban cities total fares seems to get closes to the rural cities. In general, the suburban cities are pretty much inbetween the urban cities and rural cities when it comes to total fares. However in the first week of April it drops. I would recommend marketing to the suburban cities during that time to try to get the total fares closer to that of the urban cities.
