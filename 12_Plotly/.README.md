# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

## Overview
Roza is in need of completing a dashboard to visualize the bacterial data of volunteers to idntify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. For this project, we used JavaScript to create data vsualizations that are accessible and interactive for clients to use. We also used Plotly.js to vidualize the data into charts that are attractive and easy to read. They are also interactive, so that data for different volunteers can be seen and analyzed.
