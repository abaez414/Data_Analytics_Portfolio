# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

## Overview
Roza is in need of completing a dashboard to visualize the bacterial data of volunteers to idntify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. For this project, we used JavaScript to create data vsualizations that are accessible and interactive for clients to use. We also used Plotly.js to vidualize the data into charts that are attractive and easy to read. They are also interactive, so that data for different volunteers can be seen and analyzed.

## The Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard
When you go to the website, you will select a Test Subject ID Number from the dropdown menu, shown here.

Once an ID number is selected, the demographic information for that volunteer will show up in the Demographic Info box below it.

To the right of this box are two charts. The first is a horizontal bar chart of the top 10 bacteria found in that person's belly button:

And next to that is a gauge chart showing how many times a week that belly button is washed.

Below this is a bubble chart showing the bacteria cultures per sample.

One will notice, when looking through the different volunteers, that the more someone washes their belly button throughout the week, the less bacteria there is and the fewer the bubbles in the bubble chart.
