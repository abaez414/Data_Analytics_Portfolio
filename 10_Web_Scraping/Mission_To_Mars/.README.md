# Mission_To_Mars

## Overview
Perform web scraping to extract data from various websites using Beautiful Soup and Splinter, store the data using MongoDB, then combine the data and present it in a website using Flask.

## Summary
Robin is a junior data scientist looking to do freelance work to help her get a job at Nasa. She needs to compile the latest information about the Mission to Mars and present it in a way that can be shared with other astrophiles. Throughout the module we helped Robin create a site containing the latest story in regard to the Mission to Mars, the latest image, and a table of facts about the Red Planet.

## Challenge
### Deliverable 1: Scrape High-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
For this deliverable we are adding to the data collected by scraping images of the four hemispheres of Mars. I used Jupyter Notebook to add the for loop that would get the images of the hemispheres of Mars.

This was then used to check the list that holds the dictionary of each image url and title.

### Deliverable 2: Update the Web App with Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
For this deliverable I had to take the .ipynb file and convert it to a .py file. I then added the dictionary of images to the scraping.py file and created a function to scrape the hemisphere image data from the .py file. I then ran the app.py file to make sure that the data was being retrieved properly. Here is the update from this module.

### Deliverable 3: Add Bootstrap 3 Components
In this deliverable we were to use Bootstrap to fine tune the website. One example I used this for was to simplify the look of the scraping button.
