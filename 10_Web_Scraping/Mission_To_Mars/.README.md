# Mission_To_Mars

## Overview
Perform web scraping to extract data from various websites using Beautiful Soup and Splinter, store the data using MongoDB, then combine the data and present it in a website using Flask.

## Summary
Robin is a junior data scientist looking to do freelance work to help her get a job at Nasa. She needs to compile the latest information about the Mission to Mars and present it in a way that can be shared with other astrophiles. Throughout the module we helped Robin create a site containing the latest story in regard to the Mission to Mars, the latest image, and a table of facts about the Red Planet.

## Challenge
### Deliverable 1: Scrape High-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
For this deliverable we are adding to the data collected by scraping images of the four hemispheres of Mars. I used Jupyter Notebook to add the for loop that would get the images of the hemispheres of Mars.
